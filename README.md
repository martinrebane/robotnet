Our autonomous transport robots safely deliver medicine and goods to hospital wards. We keep healthcare workers and patients safe by reducing the risk of exposure to viruses and bacteria.

## Our problem

Hospital porters deliver medicine and goods to many wards in a large hospital. This puts them into a risk of catching or carrying viruses and bacteria. Hence there is a need for excessive PPE (personal protective equipment) which takes time, slows down delieveries, reduces the amount of delieveris per person, and still holds the risk of infection.

## Our solution

Robotnet's automated hospital robots are part of our larger hospital indoor logistic solution. We automate robots, lifts and doors such that automatic deliveries are fast, safe and sustainable in large hospital buildings.

## Our technology

We are using state of the art 3D deep learning navigation algorithms combined with auxiliary safety algorithms to ensure safe operation.

## Our robot platform

The core of our solution is our robot platform which is able to safely carry 500 kg goods.
